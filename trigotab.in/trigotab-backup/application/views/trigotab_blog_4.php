                            <p>Experts have notoriously named diabetes <em>the silent killer</em>. And with good reason. You donâ€™t just wake up one day with a blood sugar level of 400. Instead, it happens slowly and gradually over time. Diabetes has a way of sneaking up on you, and because it does it so stealthily, in most cases, by the time people resort to corrective measures, the body has already become insulin-resistant.</p>

                                    <h3>Fenugreek to the Rescue</h3>
                                    <p>Whether you are a diabetes patient or at risk of developing insulin resistance, there is an ingenious solution to preventing, managing, and even reversing diabetes - <em>Fenugreek</em> or <em>Methi</em>. And it is backed by science. According to recent studies, Fenugreek lowers blood sugar levels in the body by slowing down the process of digestion and the absorption of carbohydrates. </p>
                                    <p>Fenugreek seeds, or <em>methi</em> dana, in particular, are a very potent source of anti-glycemic substances. The active agent present in Fenugreek that combats diabetes is called Trigonelline. Trigonelline safely reduces blood sugar levels and HbA1c levels in the body. With its high therapeutic potential for diabetes reversal, Trigonelline is a plant alkaloid that decreases diabetic glycosuria. It has also been proven to positively affect diabetes-induced auditory neuropathy (nerve damage) and platelet aggregation (which leads to blood clots). Trigonelline acts by affecting insulin secretion and enzyme activity related to glucose metabolism.</p>

                            </div>

                            <p>The Fenugreek plant is native to Asia and parts of North Africa. Fenugreek leaves are commonly used in many food preparations, but because of their pharmacological value and low levels of toxicity, other parts of the Fenugreek plant, such as the seeds which mature in long pods, are widely used to prevent and cure diabetes and nerve diseases.</p>

                                    <h3>Health Benefits of Fenugreek</h3>
                                    <p>Fenugreek has been used in traditional medicine for thousands of years. In ancient Rome, Fenugreek was used to aid labour and delivery in pregnant women. Fenugreek seeds are used as a power tonic to treat weakness and oedema of the legs in traditional Chinese medicine. In India, Fenugreek is commonly used as a lactation stimulant and in treating indigestion and baldness. There are numerous other medicinal uses of Fenugreek:</p>

                            <h4>1.	Managing Diabetes</h4>
                            <p>Studies have demonstrated the antidiabetic potential of Fenugreek in both, Type I (insulin-dependent) and Type II diabetes. In addition, fenugreek seeds are effective in improving metabolic symptoms associated with both types of diabetes.</p>
                            <h4>2.	Reversing Diabetes</h4>
                            <p>Consuming Fenugreek regularly has shown to lower the HbA1c average over time and, by extension, the dependency on medication and injections to regulate the blood sugar levels in the body. In addition, fenugreek seeds have a high content of soluble fibre, which helps in slowing down digestion. Fenugreek is also responsible for reversing protein glycation (responsible for diabetes-related complications) caused by hyperglycemia.</p>

                                    <h4>3.	Lowering Cholesterol Levels</h4>
                                    <p>Fenugreek is highly effective in slowing down the absorption rate of carbohydrates in the body, which then results in the lowering of cholesterol levels. More on this is discussed later!</p>

                            <p>Being anti-inflammatory in nature, Fenugreek aids digestion by easing gastritis, boosting the metabolism related to digestion, and stimulating appetite.</p>
                            <p>Some other allied benefits of consuming Fenugreek every day are:</p>

                                    <h3>Advantages of Sprouted Fenugreek</h3>
                                    <p>Sprouted fenugreek seeds have special antidiabetic properties. They improve the body's glucose tolerance and lower LDL (bad cholesterol), total cholesterol, and triglycerides. In a controlled trial, diabetic patients were given 25 grams of sprouted fenugreek seeds twice a day, and their fasting blood sugar (FBS) and post-prandial blood sugar (PPBS) levels were recorded on day 1, day 15, day 30, and day 45. The study concluded that a drastic decrease in FBS and PPBS levels was recorded compared to the control group.</p>
                                    <p>Despite all these benefits, the hassle of soaking fenugreek seeds every night can be a tedious process. But the good news is that you can consume Fenugreek seeds in the form of Trigotab Fenugreek Seed Powder tablets. After years of formulation research, Hetero Healthcare has utilized an indigenously developed sprouting technology to bring you Trigotab tablets. Trigotab contains ten times more Trigonelline (the antiglycemic agent in Fenugreek) than regular soaked fenugreek seeds. As a result, it safely reduces blood sugar levels and HbA1c levels in your body. With ten times more Trigonelline than normal fenugreek seeds, Trigotab tablets are a fast-action dietary supplement with many, many benefits!</p>

                                    <h3>How Much Fenugreek Should I Consume?</h3>
                                    <p>Experts recommend consuming at least 100 grams of soaked fenugreek seeds daily to get the maximum therapeutic benefits from fenugreek seeds. This involves procuring and soaking the seeds overnight before consuming. However, with a hectic lifestyle and other priorities, it is sometimes impossible to follow through with natural remedies. This is where nutraceuticals come to the rescue! You can simply consume Trigotab Fenugreek Seed Powder tablets as a dietary supplement every day, and your daily intake of Fenugreek will be sorted and taken care of! Over time, you will observe that your blood sugar levels are in control and that you require less and less diabetes medication.

                                    <p>Trigotab is the ultimate solution for diabetes that has become impossible to control despite all kinds of medication and therapy. Trigotab Fenugreek Powder tablets contain ten times more Trigonelline making them far more effective than regular fenugreek seeds. Trigotab has a three-step action that fights diabetes from three directions:</p>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>It regenerates beta cells and increases insulin secretion with the help of Trigonelline.</li>
                                        <li>It increases insulin sensitivity.</li>
                                        <li>Also, it reduces the absorption of glucose in the intestine.</li>
                                    </ol>
                                    <p>Trigotab has proven to effectively lower HbA1c and glycemic variability when given as add-on therapy with oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs) and insulin. Not only that, the long-term use of Trigotab results in reduction of the dose of OADs and insulin. </p>
