                            <p>Diabetes is more than just a lifestyle disease today. If you or a loved one has diabetes, you will know that diabetes has a way of creeping into your life and slowly taking over it completely. Soon there is a daily struggle, cost, and stress of managing this disease - the strict diet, the daily medications, the insulin injections that you cannot afford to miss, and the sudden, unexpected drop in blood sugar levels that lead to hypoglycemic episodes. All this stress makes the existing diabetic condition even worse and eventually becomes a vicious cycle of stress.</p>
                            <p>But do not lose heart! There is good news. When science teams up with age-old wisdom, miracles happen.</p>
                            <h3>Benefits of Going Natural</h3>
                            <p>Diabetes Mellitus, commonly known as diabetes, is caused by the inability of the pancreas to produce enough insulin to manage blood sugar levels. There are many natural remedies such as fenugreek (methi), moringa, mango leaves, amla, cinnamon, and bilberry that can help manage diabetes and even reverse the disease in some cases.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Natural remedies have rich healing properties that have been used in medicines for thousands of years.</li>
                                <li>They help in boosting your immune system.</li>
                                <li>Natural remedies don’t just cure the symptoms. They cure the root cause of the disease, thereby healing it completely.</li>
                                <li>They do not contain chemicals and contaminants that are harmful to your body.</li>
                                <li>Natural remedies usually have very little or no side effects.</li>
                            </ul>
                            
                            <p>Now that you are aware of the benefits of natural remedies let us look at some of the most effective remedies that you can try.</p>
                            <h3>Natural Remedies to Fight Diabetes</h3>
                            
                            <p>Here are some natural remedies you can try out to lower your blood sugar levels and manage your diabetes better:</p>
   
                        	<div class="bimg_section">
                        	    <div class="bimg_content">
                        	        <h4>1.	Fenugreek or <em>Methi</em></h4>
                    	           <p>Among all the natural remedies for diabetes, fenugreek has proven to be one of the most potent cures for diabetes. According to recent studies, adding Fenugreek seeds to a diabetic patient’s diet can significantly reduce blood glucose levels and considerably improve glucose tolerance. Reduction is because fenugreek contains a special amino acid that makes the body’s insulation secretion easier.</p>
                        	    </div>
                        	   	<div class="rtimg">
                        	   	     <img src="<?php echo base_url();?>uploads/blog/blog_2_1.png" alt="">
                        	   	 </div>
                        	 </div>
                            
                            <p>Fenugreek is grown in South Asia, parts of the Mediterranea, and North Africa. The fenugreek plant has small rounded leaves, and it has long pods that contain seeds (methi dana) that taste bitter. It is known for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.</p>
                            <p>Fenugreek seeds lower blood sugar by slowing down the process of digestion and the absorption of carbohydrates in the body. This is because fenugreek seeds have a high content of soluble fibre. This property helps in treating diabetes significantly. </p>
                            <p>After several clinical trials, experts have concluded that fenugreek seeds effectively improve metabolic symptoms associated with both Types I (insulin-dependent) and Type II diabetes. In addition, fenugreek seeds improve the body’s glucose tolerance and lower blood glucose levels. </p>
                            
                            <div class="bimg_section">
                                <div class="bimg_content">
                                    <p>Sprouted fenugreek seeds have special anti-diabetic properties. Trigonelline, an active ingredient in fenugreek with a very high therapeutic potential, lowers sugar levels, improves glucose tolerance, and lowers LDL (bad cholesterol), total cholesterol, and triglyceride levels. In a controlled trial, diabetic patients were given 25 grams of sprouted fenugreek seeds twice a day, and their fasting blood sugar (FBS) and post-prandial blood sugar (PPBS) levels were recorded on day 1, day 15, day 30, and day 45. The study reported that drastic decreases in FBS and PPBS levels were recorded compared to the control group.</p>
                                    <p>Despite very evident benefits, the treatment of diabetes with fenugreek seeds can be a bit challenging. To get the most therapeutic benefits, it is important to consume at least 100 grams of soaked fenugreek seeds daily. It involves procuring and soaking the fenugreek seeds overnight before consuming them. </p>
                                    <p>One of the easiest ways to take fenugreek everyday is Trigotab Fenugreek tablets. Soaking fenugreek seeds every night and then consuming them the next day can be a tedious task. To make things easier, you can simply go for Trigotab Fenugreek tablets. They not only save time, but are also more effective. Trigotab tablets contain 10 times more Trigonelline (the active ingredient that lowers sugar levels) than regular soaked fenugreek seeds. </p>

                                    <p>A common household ingredient in India, Bitter Gourd or Karela, is notorious for its bitter taste, but a glass of karela juice daily is quite beneficial in regulating blood sugar levels. Combine half a karela with half a cucumber and two stalks of celery, and drink this concoction once every day for best results. If you don’t want to go through this fuss every day, you can simply enjoy some Karela biscuits and take advantage of all the goodness of this superfood.</p>

Aloe vera can effectively lower the HbA1c average over time. Take a glass of aloe vera juice regularly but exercise caution if you combine it with conventional treatment as it can bring your sugar level crashing down abruptly.</p>
