    						<h1 class="card-title">Benefits of Trigotab in the Fight Against Stubborn Diabetes</h1>
    						<p>In India, approximately 11.8% of people above the age of 34 years have diabetes. This is a very concerning percentage, and it is only increasing year after year. While some environmental and genetic factors can be the contributing factors here, in most cases, diabetes is triggered by erroneous eating habits, a sedentary lifestyle, and constant stress. In addition, recent studies show that erratic blood sugar levels can also be triggered by stress-inducing immunity diseases such as COVID-19.</p>
    						<p>Diabetes refers to a group of metabolic diseases characterized by hyperglycemia due to defects in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both. The chronic hyperglycemia of diabetes is responsible for long-term damage, dysfunction, and failure of different organs, especially the eyes, kidneys, nerves, heart, and blood vessels. Type I diabetes is caused by beta cell destruction in the pancreas and is less common. Type II Diabetes refers to hyperglycemia due to insulin resistance with relative insulin deficiency in the body. It is the most common form of diabetes. Other kinds of diabetes include Gestational Diabetes that occurs during pregnancy and diabetes in children.</p>
    						<h4>What is Stubborn Diabetes?</h4>
    						<p>The biggest challenge that diabetic patients face today is <em>stubborn diabetes</em>. It is diabetes that just wonâ€™t budge or get better no matter what changes you make to your diet, lifestyle, or medication. This form of uncontrolled diabetes is worsened if the patient is not able to get it diagnosed on time or stick to a treatment plan. Not adhering to a treatment plan can spin the blood glucose levels out of control and lead to a heart attack, heart failure, stroke, kidney failure, coma, and eventually, death. Cardiovascular disease is reportedly the leading cause of death in adults with diabetes.</p>
    						<p>Non-adherence to a prescribed treatment plan is the primary reason for uncontrolled diabetes or stubborn diabetes. In many cases, diabetes goes unnoticed and undiagnosed. This can be because of many reasons such as:</p>
    						<ol>
    							<li>Lack of awareness about the symptoms of diabetes to look out for.</li>
    							<li>Reluctance to consult a doctor or to get tested.</li>
    							<li>Underestimating the devastating effects and complications of diabetes.</li>
    							<li>Inability to afford treatment and a supportive diet and lifestyle.</li>
    							<li>Lack of resources and infrastructure to combat the disease.</li>
    						</ol>
    						<p>If diabetes goes undiagnosed or remains uncontrolled with severely high or severely low glucose levels, it can cause devastating, long-lasting harm to the body. If diabetes is left uncontrolled, it can lead to the following complications:</p>
    						<ol>
    							<li>Severe skin conditions</li>
    							<li>Delay in the healing of wounds, leading to a risk of amputation</li>
    							<li>Loss of vision</li>
    							<li>Nerve Damage or Neuropathy</li>
    							<li>Kidney disease or Nephropathy</li>
    							<li>Hypertension</li>
    							<li>Heart disease</li>
    							<li>Stroke</li>
    						</ol>
    						<div class="bimg_section">
    							<div class="bimg_content">
    								<p><em>To de-escalate the complications of stubborn diabetes, you can make certain changes, such as including natural Trigonelline supplements in your diet. Trigonelline is a naturally occurring substance found in fenugreek with very high anti-glycemic and anti-inflammatory properties. Trigonelline is abundantly present in Trigotab Fenugreek Tablets.</em>

    						<h3>Trigotab for Stubborn Diabetes</h3>
    						<p>When insulin is not enough to tackle high blood sugar, you need a potent alternative. Trigotab Fenugreek tablets are a fact-action solution to stubborn diabetes. Trigotab Fenugreek tablets contain 10 times more Trigonelline than regular fenugreek seeds. It is extracted from fenugreek seeds using a patented BAAS sprouting technology, which ensures that every tablet is packed with diabetes-fighting goodness.</p>
    						<div class="bimg_section">
    							<div class="bimg_content">
    								<p>Trigotab works on three levels to counter the effects of diabetes -</p>
    								<p>1. It regenerates beta cells in the pancreas and increases insulin secretion with the help of Trigonelline. In addition to this, Trigotab increases insulin sensitivity and reduces the glucose absorption activity in the intestine.</p>
    								<p>2. Trigotab is usually prescribed as an add-on therapy along with oral anti-diabetic drugs (OADs) or insulin to combat stubborn diabetes. Clinical trials have concluded that Trigotab does not interfere with OADs such as Metformin and has shown long-term effect in reducing hbA1c(Glycated Hemoglobin).</p>
    								<p>3. It is completely safe to use, although it may cause mild stomach discomfort in some cases while the body is getting used to it. The recommended dosage for Trigotab Fenugreek tablets is 1000 mg orally, three times a day before meals.</p>

    						<p>Fighting stubborn diabetes takes up a lot of energy and requires a lot of motivation. Hetero Healthcare has spent years researching ways to make the treatment and management of diabetes easier. Here are some of the ways that Trigotab makes the lives of diabetic patients easier:</p>
    						<div class="bimg_section">
    							<div class="bimg_content">
    							    <h4>1. Reduces Pill Burden</h4>
    								<p>Over the years, it becomes difficult for a diabetic patient to deal with the constant increase in the number of diabetic medications and dosage. Side-effects become more and more difficult to bear. This leads to a pill burden. Knowing that these medications are to be taken for life add more to the stress, which then becomes a vicious cycle. Trigotab reduces this pill burden by effectively lowering blood sugar levels and by not letting the disease progress further.</p>

    						<div class="bimg_section">
    							<div class="bimg_content">
    							    <h4>2.	Reduces the Burden of Cost</h4>
    								<p>Managing diabetes is not easy on the pocket. The cost of insulin has increased exponentially in the past two decades. Due to this, a lot of diabetic patients are unable to adhere to a proper treatment plan. Trigotab is not only extremely affordable, but it also reduces dependence on expensive medicines and insulin.</p>

    						</div>
    						<h4>3.	It is a Safe Alternative</h4>
    						<p>Trigotab is completely safe to use, and it is well-tolerated by the body. After years of medical research, Trigotab has been formulated to serve as a safe alternative or supplement to oral anti-diabetic drugs with minimal to no side effects. It also significantly reduces glucose variability.</p>
    						<p>Trigotab Fenugreek tablets, coupled with a holistic change in your lifestyle, can drastically lower your blood glucose levels and even reverse diabetes in some cases. So, add this age-old, science-backed herbal remedy to your diet today!</p>
